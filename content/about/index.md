## My Golf Story

I started playing golf as a kid, and while i took a break from the game during college I have now made my return to the game and have been hooked ever since. I am a range warrior that is tyring to heal some scars left behind by junior golf as well as cope with swinging the club well and still scoring bad. As a 10 handicap player, I've experienced both the thrills of great rounds and the challenges that every golfer faces. Through this blog, I aim to:
