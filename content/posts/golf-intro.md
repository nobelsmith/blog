# My Golf Journey

I started playing golf as a kid, and while I took a break from the game during college I have now returned to the game and have been hooked ever since. I am a range warrior who is trying to heal some scars left behind by junior golf as well as cope with swinging the club well and still scoring badly. As a mid-handicap player, I've experienced both the thrills of great rounds and the challenges that every golfer faces. Through this blog, I aim to:

- Document my progress and lessons learned
- Provide tips and insights for fellow golfers
- Connect with the golfing community
- Share detailed course reviews and experiences

Remember: Golf is not just a game, it's a journey of continuous improvement and enjoyment.

1. **Progress Updates**: Regular updates on my journey to lower my handicap, including:

   - Practice routines
