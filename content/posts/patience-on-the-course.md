As a 10 handicap golfer, I've learned that patience is not just a virtue in golf—it's a necessity. Patience is one of the fruits of the spirit, and being a born-again believer I have access to unlimited patience right? Well not exactly, while actively seeking Christ and living according to his word will produce patience in us, but none of us are perfect. That being said next time you duff a chip or blade a sand wedge 200 yards being patient with yourself and slow to anger might just rescue your round.

## Applicable Verses

> "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law." - Galatians 5:22-23

> "Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters: You must all be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry." - James 1:19

> "Do not be quickly provoked in your spirit, for anger resides in the lap of fools." - Ecclesiastes 7:9

> "Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer." - Romans 12:12

> “Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.” - Philippians 4:6

These verses are fantastic verses to recall during your daily walk but can be especially helpful on the course. I do not mean to compare squares on a scorecard to the situation Paul was writing about while imprisoned in Rome, but for a lot of us, golf is a big part of our lives. We are called to be the salt and light of the earth, and we are not suddenly exempt from that once we step onto the first tee. So next time you want to snap your putter over your knee remember these verses and instead act according to the spirit!

## Practical Applications

1. **Waiting for the Right Moment**

   - Not every club is a birdie club

     - You are not always going to throw darts with your four iron.
     - If you miss the green that's normal go get up and down.
     - You shouldn't aim at every pin.

   - Know when to take risks and when to play safe

     - You don't have to be the hero when you are in trouble just take your medicine.
     - You don't have to go for every par 5 in 2.
     - Hitting clubs other than driver off the tee is totally acceptable.

   - Trusting in the process, not just the outcome

     - Progression in golf is not linear
     - Focusing on results is not a good measure of growth as a player
     - Comparison is the thief of joy

2. **Dealing with Adversity**

   - Bad shots as opportunities for growth
     - Don't be a hero take your medicine, stay positive, and move on.
   - Weather conditions as tests of character
     - Praise the Lord that we have the means and ability to play in the first place.
   - Fellow players' pace of play can be a chance to practice patience
     - The people in front of you aren't the reason you just three putt stop projecting.

3. **Spiritual Parallels**
   - The importance of preparation
     - In life, when we pray for situations we know are coming
     - In golf, we hit balls so we know our distances
   - Trusting in God's plan
     - In life, know God has GOOD PLANS for us
     - In golf, you should have a course management plan
   - Maintaining focus
     - In life, we are called to be present and focus on the things above
     - In golf, being patient and focusing on your next shot after a mistake will make a world of difference.

## Lessons Learned

Through my journey in both faith and golf, I've discovered that patience isn't about waiting passively—it's about maintaining a positive attitude and trusting in the process. Whether you're waiting for a breakthrough in your game or your spiritual life, remember that growth often happens in the waiting. Sometimes we can feel as though we practice patience well in many aspects of our lives. Personally, I struggle to be patient with myself. In golf especially it is easy to be angry with yourself for your performance. One practical thing that I try my best to do is to talk to myself as I would if I were talking to one of my friends. It is remarkable that we will say things to ourselves that we would NEVER say to one of our buddies on the course. Golf is hard if you can be patient and do your best to act according to the fruit of the spirit you will at the very least be a city on a hill that cannot be hidden.

## Prayer on the Course

I often find myself praying during rounds, not nessecarily for good shots, but for the wisdom to accept whatever comes my way. Also especially for patientce in bad situations. It is important to remeber that people are always watching us and reacting counter culturally to a bad situation could be a fantastic opportunity to set yourself apart and sow seeds.

Remember: Just as we trust in God's timing for our spiritual growth, we must trust in the process of improving our golf game. Every round is an opportunity to practice both patience and faith.
