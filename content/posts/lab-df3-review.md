When it comes to putting, we're all searching for a mythical magic eraser that will cure all of our putting woes. Today, I'm diving into my experience with the LAB Golf putter. Although LAB is currently making waves in the industry, it is too soon to tell whether or not Lie Angle Balance technology is truly the future.

## My Personal Experience

My very first thought about the DF3 was holy cow this thing is ugly. Immediately upon picking you might think that someone accidentally bent the shaft, but a slight forward press is built into the grip of the putter. Also, if you are a former blade enjoyer like myself you might be thrown off by the additional weight. However, the lab putter is heavier than a blade it oddly doesn't feel as heavy as it should given its looks, and is certainly lighter than many mallets on the market. All of these things were rushing through my head as I brought my new putter home and went straight to my putting mat. For context, my usual putting routine is hitting six-footers until I miss, and with my old Taylormade Ghost Tour, I was able to consistently make 8 to ten in a row with my best being 14. Running the same drill with the lab putter as soon as I took the plastic off of the grip I poured in 30 six-footers in a row! When I eventually did miss I started over and made 40 in a row my next attempt. I kid you not my first reaction was to call all my friends and tell them to take out a second mortgage to get one in the bag as fast as possible. Unfortunately, this putting mat high was met with some on-course lows. I immediately put the DF3 in the bag, and while I was extremely confident that I could hit my line speed control was another story. In my first week of ownership with the DF3 I had a few putts that ended up further from the hole than I started. Overall, I am happy to say that those were just growing pains, and after completing my first month with the DF3 I am feeling as confident as ever standing all of my putts. I think the best part of the DF3 is actually a side effect. It has allowed me to trust the putter and focus only on my target allowing me to no longer overthink my stroke on every putt.

## The Technology Behind LAB

LAB Golf's Lie Angle Balance technology represents a significant departure from traditional putter design. While most putters are either face-balanced or toe-hang, LAB putters are engineered to maintain their face angle throughout the stroke regardless of shaft angle. This is achieved through precise weight distribution and a patented shaft configuration that aligns the putter's balance point with the lie angle. The idea behind LAB putters is that the face fights to stay square throughout the enter stroke.

## On-Course Testing

### Setup and Alignment

I personally have the T alignment aid that is roughly as big as the ball. Unlike the other LAB putters I tried I found the DF3 very intuitive to align. I feel as though it is easy for me to get the putter sitting flat on the ground, and from there use the alignment aid to aim at my target. One thing that I like about the vertical portion of the T being the size of the golf ball is that it helps me to setup with the ball in the center of the putter. I feel as though it is leading to more consistent center strikes.

### Feel and Feedback

The feel of the DF3 is weird, to say the least. The most normal part is the face which feels like many other milled putters on the market. I find the natural forward press comforting, but if that is not something you are used to it could be a turn off. I find it very easy to make smooth longer strokes with the lab, and if you are willing to relinquish your control of the putter and let it do its thing I think you will find it to be very comfortable.

### Performance

#### Short Putts (Inside 6 feet)

Short putts are where the DF3 excels. It is extremely easy to hit your line, and as long as you pick good ones you will make a lot of putts within feet. I do not have a problem making putts inside 3 feet with the DF3, but admittedly it does feel strange making extremely short strokes. Longer more fluid strokes feel better to me, but that could also just be a personal preference.

#### Mid-Range Putts (6-20 feet)

I find that I am actually making more mid-range putts than I ever have. I personally would attribute the improvement in this section to the new ability to not fixate on my stroke, and instead focus on my target and treat these putts like a speed drill. Once I pick a target I no longer think about my line only my speed, and this has been made possible by my trust that the DF3 is going to stay square on its own.

#### Long Putts (20+ feet)

I was feeling terrible standing over long putts for the majority of the first month with the DF3. I was having some horrible speed issues with uphill putts and downhill putts alike. However, I will be the first to admit that this was absolutely a problem with me and not an issue with the putter. After a lot of grinding, I am only averaging half a three-putt across my last three rounds and I no longer am quaking in fear standing over long putts.

#### Putts from the Fringe

I am not a fantastic golfer and for that reason, I will unashamedly reach for the putter when I am on the fringe and sometimes even in the first cut. I will say that while the DF3 is an engineering marvel it does not glide through the grass gracefully. I have had my fair share of strokes grabbed by grass, and now I am leaning more heavily on the ole bump and run to get the job done.

## What Sets It Apart

### Pros

- Helps you hit putts online
- Huge confidence booster
- Unlike any other putter on the market

### Cons

- Ugly
- Forces you into a forward press
- Center shaft gets in the way of large alignment aids

## Value Proposition

I think that the DF3 is fairly priced at $450. That being said I also no longer am of the opinion that you must get one in the bag as quickly as possible. I think that if you are in the market for something like a new Scottie or a Ping PLD then you would be foolish to not at least give this putter a look. However, if you are a budget-conscious golfer then this putter is not for you, and your money would be better spent elsewhere in the bag.

## Final Verdict

At the end of the day, I think that the DF3 lives up to the hype and delivers on all of the promises that it makes. It really does make it easier to roll the ball end over end, and if you have putting problems try this putter out and it could be worth every penny to you like it is for me.

## Tips for Getting Started

If you're considering making the switch to a LAB putter, here are some adjustment tips I've learned:

1. Focus on getting the lab to sit flat on the ground before every putt
2. Lean into the forward press instead of fighting it
3. Longer smoother strokes make the putter feel less clunky
