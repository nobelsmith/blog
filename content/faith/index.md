## Scripture & Golf

> "But they who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength; they shall mount up with wings like eagles; they shall run and not be weary; they shall walk and not faint." - Isaiah 40:31

This verse reminds me of the patience and perseverance needed in both our faith journey and our golf game. Stay tuned for more reflections on how Scripture guides us in golf and life.
